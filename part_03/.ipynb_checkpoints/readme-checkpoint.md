# Part 3

## Overview

The finish line is in sight! You should have your data in hand and some models made. This portion of the Capstone contains two parts to help really hone your model and develop mastery over your final project.

*Goal*: A written progress report on your project and a detailed 1:1 with your instructor.

---

## Requirements

Submit a progress report detailing where you are with your Capstone in your repo. The format and content is up to you but, at a minimum, we expect the following:

1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?
2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?
3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?
4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?
5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?
6. What is your timeline for the next week and a half? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?\

## Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Push your progress report (touching on the points above) to your repo.
